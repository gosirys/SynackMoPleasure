Scripts, helpers and configs to make hacking on Synack less painful

  
## TuPOC HTTP OOB PHP Logger
This [PHP script](https://github.com/gosirys/SynackMoPleasure/blob/main/tupoc_oob_phplogger.php) was created to test/exploit SSRF (HTTP only, no DNS) on targets that only accept TuPOC.

It grabs the entire HTTP request (all headers) from the client, stores the interaction in the logs and sends you a notification over Discord.
