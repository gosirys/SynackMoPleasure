## TuPOC HTTP OOB PHP Logger
This [PHP script](https://github.com/gosirys/SynackMoPleasure/blob/main/tupoc_oob_phplogger.php) was created to SSRF (HTTP) on targets with RoE that only allows TuPOC.

It fetches the entire HTTP request (all headers) from the client, stores the interaction in the logs and send you a notification over Discord.
